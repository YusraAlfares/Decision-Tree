# Decision Tree

## Assigmnet Description & details

This Assignment is about implementing the Decision Tree algorithm using Python and Jupyter notebook, while using the stroke dataset. 
Any libraries can be used to help implement the Assignment.
However, this Decision tree will face the overfitting problem, and is adderessed and mitigated using pruning. 

Decision Trees are one of the most popular machine learning algorithms due to their simplicity and interpretability. They work by splitting data into branches based on feature values, allowing for easy decision-making and classification.

## How Decision Trees Work:

Root Node: The process starts at the root, where the best feature to split the data is chosen, often based on metrics like Information Gain or Gini Impurity.

Splits and Nodes: Each split creates branches leading to nodes, dividing data into smaller groups. The goal is to maximize the separation of data into the target classes.

Leaves: The end nodes, or leaves, represent final decisions or classifications. Once a leaf is reached, predictions are made based on the majority class or average value within that node.

## Advantages of Decision Trees:

Easy to Interpret: Visual representation makes it clear how decisions are made.
Versatile: Can be used for classification and regression tasks.

## Application with the Stroke Dataset:
In this assignment, the decision tree model will classify or predict based on stroke-related features. Features like age, hypertension, heart disease, and more will help the tree decide on the likelihood of a stroke, providing insights into critical factors.
